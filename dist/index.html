          <p>There once was a guy named Grimblo. 
          Grimblo was an ordinary guy who had teleportation powers (which is totally normal, trust me). 
          One day, Grimblo got bored and decided to go traveling.</p>

        <p>The first place Grimblo decided to visit was a cave. 
        It was a very creepy cave full of mysterious creatures that watched Grimblo from the shadows.
        "Woah. Creepy." Grimblo said before promptly leaving.</p>

        <p>The next place Grimblo teleported into was a strange store. 
        The shopkeeper running the store carried around a sign that simply said "AAA."
        Grimblo tried to ask what the sign meant, but the shopkeeper wouldn't answer him.
        Eventually Grimblo got bored, and he left.</p>

        <p>After the store fiasco, Grimblo found himself standing in front of an erupting volcano. 
          "Wow. Cool." Grimblo said. 
          Grimblo wanted to stay and watch the world burn, but he figured that he had better things to do. 
          As such, Grimblo teleported somewhere else.

        <p>Grimblo then suddenly found himself in space.
          Grimblo thought space was beautiful, but found the lack of oxygen to be a problem.
          Grimblo got uncomfortable from his lack of breathing and decided to leave.

        <p>Grimblo ended his day by teleporting himself into the dark, expansive abyss of the void. While Grimblo didn't find his day to be very exciting, he was at least less bored than how he started. Hooray for Grimblo.</p>
